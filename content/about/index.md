:wave: Hello! I'm Ivy.

I am a web application focused software engineer. I primarily work in Elixir and React based projects.

In my free time, I enjoy :video_game: gaming, :running: running, :yarn: crochet and I often foster kittens :cat: for Austin Pets Alive!

Hopefully if you've stumbled across my site you get some benefit out of my posts. 

Thanks for reading!
