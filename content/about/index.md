    <p>I'm a software engineer in Austin, Texas.</p>
    <p>I love to game, travel and have recently gotten into photography. In the past few years I've traveled to, in alphabetical order: Canada, Iceland, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, the UK and hopefully many more to come. If you go to my photography section right now you can find pictures from 2018 and onward.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out!</p>
